# Ibniz for MacOS X

This is a pre-compiled and bundled version of [Ibniz](http://pelulamu.net/ibniz/) 1.18 for MacOS X. Ibniz is “a hardcore audiovisual virtual machine and an esoteric programming language”:

> IBNIZ is a virtual machine designed for extremely compact low-level audiovisual programs. The leading design goal is usefulness as a platform for demoscene productions, glitch art and similar projects. Mainsteam software engineering aspects are considered totally irrelevant.

More info and documentation on the [project page](http://pelulamu.net/ibniz/) or [GH repo](https://github.com/hornos/ibniz).

**I did NOT write Ibniz**: it's been created by Ville-Matias Heikkila. This repo simply provides a version of Ibniz that's been pre-compiled and packaged into a .app, making it easy for artists and VJs to try out and use Ibniz without having to fuss with installing devtools and SDL on OSX, or even use the command line; simply download and double-click on the .app.

## Compatibility

This has been compiled on OSX El Capitan. It *should* work on previous versions of OSX but I haven't tested that yet.
There's also a bug on OSX (presumably due to the Ctrl/Cmd switch) that prevents copying and pasting within the editor, as well as using Cmd-Q to quit (though simply closing the window will work). May fix that in the future.
